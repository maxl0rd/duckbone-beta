# Templates
This file packages all Handlebars templates for the asset pipeline. It creates
two objects, which hold all templates and partials as strings. All templates are
passed through ERB, regardless of their file extension.

## Usage

To include templates, simply add `//= require templates` to your application.js
manifest, typically at the end.

All templates should be defined somewhere in `/app/assets/javascripts`,
typically `/app/assets/javascripts/backbone/templates`. Files beginning with an
underscore will be treated as partials, and all other files ending in .hbs will
become full templates.

This script will detect any changes to existing templates and recompile.
However, when new templates are added, it may be necessary to call
`rake assets:clean` for the new templates to be detected.
